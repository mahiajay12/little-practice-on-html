   <p>Now we are going to talk about how to <b><em>italisise</em></b> or <b>bold</b> the text. We can do it by using em
      or i tag for italisise and b or strong for bold.</p>

   <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
   <p>At its heart, <u>HTML</u> is a fairly simple language made up of <u>elements</u>, which can be applied to pieces
      of text to give them different meaning
      in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into
      logical sections
      (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos
      into a page. This
      module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to
      understand HTML. HTML
      allows people to create and design web pages using elements such as: </p>
   <ul>
      <li>paragraphs,</li>
      <li>headings,</li>
      <li>links,</li>
      <li>quotes,</li>
      <li>images etc.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>HTML is now an official web standard which is monitored and developed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</b>
   </p>
   <!--NOTE: The unordered list or the bullet points can be mentioned by ul and the ordered list or the points in alphabetical order or in
             numeric order can be listed by (ol type="i") for roman numeral and (ol start="1") for numeric -->

      <p>A surprisingly high percentage of corporate websites are built on WordPress. And this is good news for you when
         you know some
         HTML and CSS, because you can use them to add content and make changes to your company‚Äôs site. That means no
         more waiting around for
         your overworked web team to update the office calendar!</p>

      <p>Speaking of overworked co-workers, how about sharing the HTML and CSS love with your colleagues (or even your
         supervisor)?
         Then everyone on your team will be able to update and improve the website, emails, and newsletters. Ahh, the

         how to tell

         (like
         JavaScript, Ruby, or PHP) a whole lot easier. And the more you know, the more job opportunities will open up
         for you.</p>

   <h4>ADDING TABLES</h4>

   <p>In order to add tables we use the <em> "table" </em>tag and we insert table rows and table data.For inserting
      the table rows we use <em>"tr"</em> and for inserting the table data we use <em>"td"</em> by which we can add
      tables
      successfully.This tag helps our program to look good and neat.Besides this the table also consists of
      table header and table footer.We use <em>"thead" </em>for table header, <em>"tbody"</em> for table body
      and <em>"tfoot" </em>for table footer.
